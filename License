📜 Conditional Attribution Requirement
Official attribution of the application to VAXP-OS or the use of the project name "vater" or "VAXP Terminal" for any modified version is strictly prohibited unless the following criteria are clearly met:

Aesthetic Criteria (Vanta Class): Maintain the original Vanta Class/Black Glass style and do not remove or alter any of the essential visual features documented in this repository.

Performance Criteria: The modified version must at least maintain or exceed the performance metrics documented here (e.g., stable memory consumption at 55MB in idle mode).

The purpose of this requirement is to incentivize developers to either differentiate and innovate (build something better under a new name) or maintain the high quality of the VAXP-OS identity if attribution is chosen.
